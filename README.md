This is an example of setting up a vagrant scirpt to spin up a Win7 or Win8.1 machine with SQL express and some basic tools via puppet and chocolaty. 
The thing i struggled with was adding the certificates for puppet modules for base images. 
As well, could not get chocolaty SQL express packages to work, so i wrote my own powershell scripts and tasks included in this file. 

Enjoy and let me know if you have questions. 

ps. I also added some sikuli testing framework setups and examples for automated testing using vagrant, jenkins, and this framework.
